<p class='infoE'><a class='link' href="https://eac85.github.io/Synthesis1/"> <strong> A dataset that you manipulated or queried using Python</strong></a>
I manipulated the data for the stacked bar graphs. I think something that was lost in making the changes was that I had to
shrink the human populations by dividing it by the population of the bee colonies. I think this made it very hard to visualize
and ruined some of the direct impact. Since the data is not bee population, it's colony population, the comparisons are off. The main idea is that human population is increasing while the bees are decreasing, but it is hard to visualize how dramatic the increase is without the bee population looking non-existent.
